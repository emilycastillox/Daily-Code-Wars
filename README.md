# Daily Code Wars

This is where I work on daily problems on codewars to hone my JavaScript skills. I recently made it to 6kyu, so hopefully I can continue practicing and progressing!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

## Lessons Learned:

I definitely want to keep practicing my JavaScript each day. I've been putting the harder to sole problems in my Anki cards so I can continue practicing. Not only this, but I have been able to work on my pseudocode and my PREP practice, so I can get ready for those technical interviews coming up. That spaced repitition is helpful to get the JavaScript concepts down.
